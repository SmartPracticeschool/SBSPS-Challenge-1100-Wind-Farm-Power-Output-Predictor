Project ID: SPS_PRO_745

Problem Statement: Predicting the energy output of wind turbine based on weather condition

Description: Wind energy plays an increasing role in the supply of energy world-wide. The energy output of a wind farm is highly dependent on the wind conditions present at its site. If the output can be predicted more accurately, energy suppliers can coordinate the collaborative production of different energy sources more efficiently to avoid costly overproduction.

Solution: Our solution is an application that has an ML model trained from real-life data, that can predict the output energy based on the weather conditions on the site area. This prediction will help the power plant operators to operate plant whenever it will be feasible.
